           You're chilling at home, scrolling through some bingeworthy,
           even some cringworthy reels. Maybe watching a Youtube video like the average person. However 
           suddenly you get a message. As you open it ,it reads,"congratulations,
           you have won XXXXX million,pls contact us to receive your reward". Sound Familiar?
           Probably because this is one of the most cliche forms of scams where the scamsters extort your identity
         and dupe you of your hard earned money. What if I say that this generation of hackers have matured beyond 
         most of these cliche methods? Moreover there are even those who are not aware of what fraud is.
         Whether you are a noob to the online world or a seasoned techie,evereyone needs an update now and then.
         After all it is in our nature to constantly have to be reminded of things. Think you can outsmart the 
         crafty web criminals? If not, no worries, we come armed with tools to help you learn. If yes,test yourself 
         with an online cyberquiz. </h3>
